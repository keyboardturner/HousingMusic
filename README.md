# Housing Music
Allows for shareable music playlists within your player house.

The primary feature of this addon is being able to craft playlists for your player house. Currently you can assign a playlist to your horde house and your alliance house independently (if more houses were to open up somehow, it should also adapt to those as well.)

Housing Music includes an interface to display the playlists for yourself and for other players, a UI for the current song duration, options to change to the previous or next song, and various settings including autoplay, sharing permissions, and mute lists. All settings can be configured once inside your home, using the top left icon in the housing manager area.

Other settings which are planned include volume controls, optional toast popups, and browser skin layout themes.
